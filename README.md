# OWeek Legacy Script

This is a really old script I found that we used for Jacobs O-Week at some point. Originally written by Tyler Buchman and then modified by me. See [LICENSE](LICENSE). 
No guarantees what-so-ever, not sure if it will ever work again. 

## How to use?
Original instructions say: 
1. Open a new text file, name it “students.txt”, and save it in the Oweek folder
2. Open the excel file with student names, and copy the student information in order with a single line break in between each section
	a. first name
	b. last name
	c. nationality
	d. major
3. cd into the Oweek folder and type “make”
4. a text file named “groups” will appear with each group inside. the students are listed under each group number as “first name, last name”
